My name is Sam Ginn. I was born in Oak Park, Illinois&mdash;a suburb of Chicago famous for the home and studio of Frank Lloyd Wright and infamous for the birthplace of Ernest Hemingway. In the Fall of 2015, I matriculated as an undergraduate student at Stanford University to explore philosophy, literature, and computer science.

You can find some of my code and projects at [github.com/samginn](https://github.com/samginn).

Any more information would rob me of the chance to talk with you directly.
